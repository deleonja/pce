abstract = {We analyze the geometry of the generalized Pauli channels constructed from the mutually unbiased bases. The Choi-Jamio{\l}kowski isomorphism allows us to express the Hilbert-Schmidt line and volume elements in terms of the eigenvalues of the generalized Pauli maps. After determining appropriate regions of integration, we analytically compute the volume of generalized Pauli channels and their important subclasses. In particular, we obtain the volumes of the generalized Pauli channels that can be generated by a legitimate generator and are entanglement breaking. We also provide the upper bound for the volume of positive, trace-preserving generalized Pauli maps. This helps us to better understand the structure of high-dimensional sets of quantum channels.},

abstract = {We analyze the geometrical properties of trace-preserving Pauli maps. Using the Choi-Jamio{\l}kowski isomorphism, we express the Hilbert-Schmidt line and volume elements in terms of the eigenvalues of the Pauli map. We analytically compute the volumes of positive, trace-preserving Pauli maps and Pauli channels. In particular, we find the relative volumes of the entanglement-breaking Pauli channels as well as the channels that can be generated by a time-local generator. Finally, we show what part of the Pauli channels are P- A nd CP-divisible, which is related to the notion of Markovianity.},
